## Overview

This document outlines the architectural decisions, patterns, and infrastructure setup for our system. It serves as the primary reference for technical decisions and implementation guidelines.

### Purpose
- Define system architecture and components
- Document technical decisions and rationale
- Provide guidance for development and deployment
- Establish standards for code quality and security

## Architecture Principles

### Core Principles
1. **Microservices-First**: Loosely coupled, independently deployable services
2. **Cloud-Native**: Designed for cloud scalability and resilience
3. **Security by Design**: Zero-trust architecture with defense in depth
4. **Observable by Default**: Comprehensive monitoring and logging
5. **Infrastructure as Code**: Automated, version-controlled infrastructure

### Design Patterns
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- Event-Driven Architecture
- Circuit Breaker Pattern
- Saga Pattern for distributed transactions

## System Components
